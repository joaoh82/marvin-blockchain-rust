Welcome to the Rust implementation of the Marvin Blockchain. This project is part of a comparative study on building the same blockchain in both Go and Rust. Follow along as we explore the development process, performance, and features of a blockchain built in Rust.

## Project Overview

Marvin Blockchain is a distributed ledger and EVM Compatible inspired by Bitcoin and Ethereum, implemented in Rust. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable blockchain solution while comparing the nuances of building the same system in Go.

## Features (WIP)

- **Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism** (Subject to Change)
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking**
- **Storage and Persistence**
- **Transaction and Block Validation**
- **Smart Contract Support via EVM Compatibility**
- **JSON-RPC API**
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests and Benchmarks**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.80 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/joaoh82/marvin-blockchain-rust.git
    cd marvin-blockchain-rust
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Running the Blockchain
To start a node on the Marvin Blockchain:
```sh
./target/release/marvin-blockchain
```

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests:
```sh
cargo test
```

### Project Progress (WIP)
- [x] Add CLI support for ease of interaction
- [x] Implemented key pair creation, sign and verify
- [x] Create key pair with mnemonic seed
- [x] Add address command to CLI
- [x] Basic transaction and block data structures and validation
- [x] Add better error handling
- [x] Add protobuf encoding/decoding
- [ ] Implement the basic blockchain data structure
